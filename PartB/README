	$ ./a.out input.pcap file

2. Output:
----------

	- The output of the program can also be seen in PartB-Output.log

3. Notes:
---------

	- Intial congestion window is calculated as: the total packets sent by
	  the client before it first gets an acknowledgement from the server. 
	  For all the flows, it was observed that the congestion window is 10
	  intially. After that, for every acknowledgement, the congestion wind
	  -ow is incremented by 1, until loss. If there is a loss, then conges
 	  -tion window is halved if it is fast retransmission otherwise it is 
	  set to 1. 
	- The total number of retransmits due to triple duplicates is calcula-
	  ted using duplicated acks more than thrice. This value is subtracted
	  from the total retransmissions to get the total retransmission due to
   	  timeouts.
