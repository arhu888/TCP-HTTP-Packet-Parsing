1. Compilation and Running:
--------------------------

	$ gcc analysis_pcap_http.c -lpcap -lm
	$ ./a.out input.pcap file

2. Output:
----------

	- The output of the program can also be seen in PartC-Output.log for
	  8092.pcap.

3. Notes:
---------

	- The tcpdump command used to capture the http traces, is:
	
	$tcpdump -s 0 -i any -w capture.pcap "src port 8094" or "dst port 8094"

	- The HTTP request and responses are assembled together using the source
	  and destination ports along with sequence number and acknowledgement.
	  The HTTP headers are printed along with 4-tuple for other packets of
	  the response.

	- The 8092 capture follows HTTP/1.0 version. The version is identified
	  using pattern of TCP flows. It is observed that, there is a unique TCP
	  connection for each HTTP request. Hence, it is HTTP/1.0 version. Next, 
	  the 8093 capture follows HTTP/1.1 version, because it is observed that
 	  there are 6 parallel connections for the entire page load. Finally, it
	  is found that 8094 is using HTTP/2.0, which is identified with sigle 
	  TCP connection throughout the whole page load.

	- It is found that HTTP/1.0 is loading faster compared to other versions
	  of HTTP (0.5sec). This is suspected due to the fact that the page is 
	  very simple and the other protocols are performing worse because of
	  encryption etc. On the other hand, HTTP/2.0 is resulting in fewer bytes
	  (2332320 bytes) compared to other versions. This is due to reduced 
	  number of syn, ack, fins during connection establishment etc.
