1. Compilation and Running:
--------------------------

	$ gcc analysis_pcap_tcp.c -lpcap -lm
	$ ./a.out input.pcap file

2. Output:
----------

	- The output of the program can also be seen in PartA-Output.log

3. Notes:
---------

	- The total number of flows observed in the given capture is 3.
	- For each flow, for the first 2 transactions, the source and destinati
	  ion sequence number, acknowledgement, window size are printed. It is 
	  observed that acknowledgement is sum of sequence number and pay load 
	  length of the packet. Here, for receiver window size, Window Scaling
	  is used, and hence multiplied the window by 2^14, where 14 is scaling
	  factor.
	- The empirical throughput id estimated by calculating the number of b-
	  ytes sent over the complete flow duration, for each flow.
	- The lossrate is estimated by calculating the total number of retrans-
	  missions over total packets.
	- The RTT is estimated using packet sent time and acknowledgment recep-
	  tion time. And then, using loss rate and RTT, the theoretical throug-
	  hput is calculted. The observed theoretical throughput is not closer
	  to empirical throughput. One reason for this is suspected is that we
	  have very less data to efficiently predict the throughput.
